## Legacy Photo Dataset (LP Dataset)

The proposed legacy photo dataset contains approximately 25000 legacy images crawed from the Internet. The images include the real noises. If you would like to use the dataset, please send the e-mail to Yuzhi Zhao (yzzhao2-c@my.cityu.edu.hk). A brief self-introduction and the usage of LP Dataset are required.
